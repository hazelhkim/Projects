Pour in the Marsala and 200ml/7fl oz cold water, bring to the boil and scrape any stuck-on bits into the liquid. Boil for 2 minutes then scrape everything into the stockpot.  Add 2.25 litres/4 pints cold water to the pot and bring to the boil over a medium heat, uncovered. Scoop off any scum, then add the vegetables and herbs. Bring back to the boil, de-scum again.  Now very gently simmer for 2 hours, adding cold water if the liquid falls below the level of the bones. Remove from the heat and drain through muslin-lined colander (or use a clean tea towel) into a heatproof bowl. Cool, then refrigerate until jellied.  Heat the butter and oil in a large, nonstick frying pan over a low-medium heat, then tip in the onions. Cook for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until meltingly soft. Turn heat to high, add the Marsala and boil for 3-4 minutes, stirring often, until onions are syrupy. Set aside.  Meanwhile, remove the solidified fat from the stock and discard. Boil the stock in a saucepan, uncovered, until reduced to 500ml/18fl oz. Add the white wine and boil for 10 minutes, uncovered. Add the onions and sage and bring back to the boil. (Prepare in advance up to this point.)  To finish the sauce, pour in the cream and boil furiously for 4-5 minutes, season to taste. Serve in a warmed jug.   \n"

    "**TODO:** Make the `SentimentNetwork` class more efficient by eliminating unnecessary multiplications and additions that occur during forward and backward propagation. To do that, you can do the following:\n",
    "* Copy the `SentimentNetwork` class from the previous project into the following cell.\n",
    "* Remove the `update_input_layer` function - you will not need it in this version.\n",
    "* Modify `init_network`:\n",
    ">* You no longer need a separate input layer, so remove any mention of `self.layer_0`\n",
    ">* You will be dealing with the old hidden layer more directly, so create `self.layer_1`, a two-dimensional matrix with shape 1 x hidden_nodes, with all values initialized to zero\n",
    "* Modify `train`:\n",
    ">* Change the name of the input parameter `training_reviews` to `training_reviews_raw`. This will help with the next step.\n",
    ">* At the beginning of the function, you'll want to preprocess your reviews to convert them to a list of indices (from `word2index`) that are actually used in the review. This is equivalent to what you saw in the video when Andrew set specific indices to 1. Your code should create a local `list` variable named `training_reviews` that should contain a `list` for each review in `training_reviews_raw`. Those lists should contain the indices for words found in the review.\n",
    ">* Remove call to `update_input_layer`\n",
    ">* Use `self`'s  `layer_1` instead of a local `layer_1` object.\n",
    ">* In the forward pass, replace the code that updates `layer_1` with new logic that only adds the weights for the indices used in the review.\n",
    ">* When updating `weights_0_1`, only update the individual weights that were used in the forward pass.\n",
    "* Modify `run`:\n",
    ">* Remove call to `update_input_layer` \n",
    ">* Use `self`'s  `layer_1` instead of a local `layer_1` object.\n",
    ">* Much like you did in `train`, you will need to pre-process the `review` so you can work with word indices, then update `layer_1` by adding weights for the indices used in the review."
